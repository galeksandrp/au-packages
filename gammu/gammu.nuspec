Gammu
Command line utility which allows to use all libGammu features.

SMSD
SMS daemon service to receive and send messages automatically.

Gammu
Gammu is the name of the project as well as name of command line utility, which you can use to control your phone. It is written in C and built on top of libGammu.

Gammu command line utility provides access to wide range of phone features, however support level differs from phone to phone and you might want to check Gammu Phone Database for user experiences with various phones. Generally following features are supported:

Call listing, initiating and handling
SMS retrieval, backup and sending
MMS retrieval
Phonebook listing, export and import (also from standard formats such as vCard)
Calendar and tasks listing, export and import (also from standard formats such as vCalendar or iCalendar)
Retrieval of phone and network information
Access to phone file system (note that some phones work also as USB storage devices and those are not accessible through Gammu)
This project has originally forked from Gnokii and up to version 0.58 has been named MyGnokii2. Then need for better name arrived and Gammu was chosen as an acronym for Gammu All Mobile Management Utilities, without knowing that Gammu from the "Heretics of Dune" book written by Frank Herbert exists.

The Gammu package does not include just this binary, but as well Gammu SMS Daemon, Gammu library and Python bindings which you can use to develop own application accessing mobile phone.</description>
